This is a set of roles & profiles to set up the various services in our
infrastructure.  If you're not a member of the Puppet Education team, this

This control repo is for the: Classroom server

* `profile::requirements`
    * Stands up representative services allowing prospective students to validate
      their connectivity prior to showing up in class and discovering that they're
      missing something.
      
* `profile::provisioner`
    * Manages the EDU VM provisioner.
